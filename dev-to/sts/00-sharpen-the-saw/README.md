# Sharpen The Saw

## Hello

Hello, my name is Sardorbek Imomaliev! I'm a software architect and an enterpeneur. You could read more about me and my development tools in [this article by ergodox-ez](https://people.zsa.io/sardorbek-imomaliev/) it is little outdated but paints a good picture about my approach to setup and also about my experience and background. To sum it up for folks who do not have as much time to read 2 articles in a row, here are some bullet points:

-   I have a Mid 2014 MacBook as my main and only work station.
-   My editor of choice is [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) which I use in combination with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/)
-   I 5 years back I swtiched to [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) keyboard layout. It is setup with [angle mode](https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/angle.html) when I use default
-   I use [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com) keyboard with [Logitech MX ERGO](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.910-005178.html)
-   Links to my [dotfiles](https://github.com/imomaliev/dotfiles) and keyboard [layout for ergodox](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/0WVVQ/latest/0)

## Preambule

I was always a perfectionist and a pedant, specifically when we are talking about efficient and correct way of doing things. When I was young I could spend hours cleaning our shoe cabinet. We used to use old newspapers to lay them on shelves to collect dust and durt. So to start cleaning process I would move all the shoes out of cabinet, then throw away all the newspapeprs that were used. After that I would vacuum and wipe with wet cloth all shelves and lay a new set of newspapers. And our cabinet is ready for shoes I would clean and polish every shoe and put them back. There were 4 shelves of them some were in boxes so the last step for me was playing tatris to feet all of them propperly.

Some may think I have an "OCD". I was never checked for it )) but I think it is highly unlikely, I can still be messy, but when things do not work the way they could or should I get annoyed very much sometimes to the point of when I can't do things properly or anything at all.

## To tweak or not to tweak

This article is a kickoff for my new series in which I will document my neverending persuit of improving workflow and tools that I use. I will share my thoughts, reasonings and how or why I decided to make changes and tweaks.

In my opinon when you are using any tool there are 2 basic approaches to mastering it.

### Not to tweak

First approach is to learn as much of a tool in its default state as possible. Get to understand its ups and downs and become native with it. This approach allows you to be more productive whenever you have to use same tool but which is owned by different owner or when someday the tool just breaks and you have to get a new one. If you are a teacher or a person who has to use other people's computers a lot you are more likely to be more efficient with their keyboard if you know how to type on QWERTY layout, because QWERTY is default and is used by majority of typists. Or lets say your a system admin and have to manually update a lot of config files. Vim or it's predecessor vi is probably installed on any server you will connect to and if you are already know vim's default keybinding you will be as efficient in doing your job as if you was doing it on your own computer.

### To tweak

Second approach is to make this tool your own by tweaking and adjusting it to your needs and special cases.
